The Mysurance application is a sample auto insurance application written in 2/2010.  It was written for both the Android and iPhone.  The Android version is saved in the "Android" directory.

The original Mysurance application was modified and segmented into steps 1-10 to be a lab tutorial session for the IBM Impact 2011 Conference.  The "Impact" directory contains this updated code.  

Code was also added to save profile and vehicle to an IBM WebSphere application server via a JAX-RS REST service.  The accident photos are uploaded to WebSphere using the FileTransfer feature in PhoneGap.  

There is a configuration screen in the application that shows the WebSphere server IP address.  If is not set, then any actions that send data to the server are ignored.
